## Remote Sensing of Hurricane Damage in Built Environments


Assessing the damage to the built environment by hurricanes can often be a physically demanding and dangerous job, as it often includes in-person site surveys. With the massive amounts of satellite data, we are interested in applying computer vision techniques to do remote sensing of damage caused by natural disasters. This project will be application-based and will test different models on the problem of damage detection. We believe that remote sensing techniques are important and applicable now, more than ever, as our world and climate rapidly change. 

This project is based off the work of Cao and Choe in 2020: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01688.pdf.

### Approaching the problem with simple models
* SVM for binary classification
* Feature engineering and image processing techniques
* Shallow neural nets

### Approaching the problem with deep models
* Transfer learning on VGG-19

### Extending the problem
* Small training set
* Application on other images
